# fc2a.org
Migrate fc2a.org into one page website

## Build
This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) extended version.
```bash
hugo --cleanDestinationDir --gc
```

## About
This is not a perfect hugo usage... if I have time, I will improve it. But for now, it is enough for me.   
And WTF is this trash SCSS and CSS classes? Some time, I probably need to sleep more...

But you know what? That's work! And it is the most important.
